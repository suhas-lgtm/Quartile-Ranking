// src/config/indices.ts — the 8 Market Pulse indices, served live from Supabase.
//
// Each index is one file in the Supabase bucket, holding its identity, latest
// close, 1-day move, a 30-point sparkline and its full 6-year daily history.
// scripts/update_indices.py refreshes them every weekday evening, so Market
// Pulse shows the day's closes without a rebuild or a deploy.
//
// The path below is proxied by netlify.toml to the public bucket. It is
// deliberately NOT under /data/index/, which holds the committed series of all
// 36 benchmarks — proxying that path would break them.
//
// TO ADD A NINTH INDEX, three lists must agree:
//   1. this file
//   2. scripts/index_store.py           STRIP
//   3. scripts/build_json.py            STRIP_INDICES
// update_indices.py refuses to run if 2 and 3 disagree.
