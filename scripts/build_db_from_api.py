"""
build_db_from_api.py — Build a complete, throwaway NAV database from api.mfapi.in.

This replaces the permanent 513 MB SQLite file. The database it produces is a
*build artifact*: created in the CI runner, consumed by build_json.py, deleted
at the end of the run. Nothing is stored between runs.

The schema it writes is byte-identical to init_db.py's, so calculation_engine.py
and build_json.py run completely unchanged — they still receive an ordinary
sqlite3.Connection and have no idea the data came from an API.

Usage:
  python scripts/build_db_from_api.py                       # -> data/mf_research.db
  python scripts/build_db_from_api.py --db /tmp/mf.db        # explicit path
  python scripts/build_db_from_api.py --limit 50             # quick smoke test
  python scripts/build_db_from_api.py --keep-indices         # reuse index_history
                                                             # from an existing DB
