daily_run.py — The whole daily pipeline, start to finish, storing nothing.

    api.mfapi.in  ──►  temp SQLite  ──►  calculation_engine  ──►  site/public/data/*.json
                       (deleted at end)      (unchanged)              (~6 MB, deployed)

Run once a day by .github/workflows/daily_update.yml. The database exists only
for the lifetime of this process; on exit it is removed. The only durable
output is the JSON the dashboard reads.

Safety: if the API pull fails, or the data looks stale or thin, the run aborts
BEFORE overwriting any JSON — so a bad upstream day leaves yesterday's working
dashboard live instead of publishing a broken one.

Usage:
  python scripts/daily_run.py
  python scripts/daily_run.py --keep-db          # keep the temp DB for debugging
  python scripts/daily_run.py --skip-indices     # NAVs only, leave index data alone
  python scripts/daily_run.py --max-staleness 5  # allow older data than default
