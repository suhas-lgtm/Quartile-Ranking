"""
index_store.py — the 8 Market Pulse indices, one file each, in Neon (files table).

    Neon <slug>.json      ──pull──►  top up from Yahoo v8  ──gate──►  push back

BUCKET LAYOUT — eight files, no folders:

    nifty-50.json  sensex.json  nifty-100.json  nifty-midcap-150.json
    nifty-smallcap-250.json  nifty-bank.json  nifty-500.json  gold-goldbees.json

Each file is self-contained: the index's identity, its latest close and 1-day
move, a 30-point sparkline, and its full daily history. So one request serves
both the Market Pulse tile and the chart behind it — the chart used to need a
second fetch.

WHY ONE FILE PER INDEX
An earlier version wrote 38 objects across index/ and indices/ folders: a
combined strip file, a rolling history archive, and a series file for all 36
benchmarks even though only these 8 are ever displayed. Eight files is the whole
requirement.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
It is not the calculation pipeline's index source. That still reads the
committed data/index_history.json.gz (2010 onward, all 36 benchmarks) and tops
it up through scripts/backfill_indices, because category benchmarks need the
other 28 indices and a 10Y benchmark return needs closes from 10 years back.
These 8 files exist purely so the deployed site can show today's closes without
a rebuild. Keeping them separate is what lets this window be 6 years without
costing the 10Y column anything.

    Remove short runs where the quoted level jumps by orders of magnitude and

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    GOLD (GOLDBEES) is quoted around Rs 33 in December 2019, except on the 19th
    and 20th, where the source reported 0.3355 and 0.3365 — the same price with
    the decimal point moved two places. On the 23rd it is back to 33.65.

    Two bad days out of 4,119 sounds harmless. It is not. A blend of NIFTY 50,
    gilt and gold rebalanced daily reads 447% annualised volatility off that
    series, against a true figure near 10%, because rebalancing re-buys at the
    corrupted price and books a 99% loss followed by a 9,900% gain. It also
    poisoned Multi Asset Blend, which is computed FROM gold and jumped 990% on
    the same day. Every risk figure downstream of either was wrong.

    WHAT IT WILL NOT TOUCH, WHICH MATTERS AS MUCH
    INDIA VIX genuinely rises 64% in a day (24 Aug 2015), 42% (5 Aug 2024) and
    66% (7 Apr 2025). Those are real and must survive, so this does not filter
    on the size of a move alone. A run qualifies only when the level RETURNS:
    the product of the ratios across it comes back to within OUTLIER_ROUND_TRIP
    of 1. A sustained move never round-trips, so a genuine spike, a crash, or a
    real re-denomination is left exactly as it is — and reported in the notes so
    a human can look rather than having it silently rewritten.

    Points are DROPPED, not rescaled. Dropping two days from a daily series
    loses nothing that matters and cannot invent a price; guessing the factor
    would put a number nobody quoted into the history.
