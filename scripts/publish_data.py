"""
publish_data.py — put the dashboard's data in Neon, organised by asset class.

WHY
Every nightly run rewrote 2,477 files inside the website, so Netlify rebuilt and
re-uploaded the whole site: ~15 minutes a deploy, ~450 minutes a month against a
300-minute allowance. The data does not belong in the build. Moving it out means
Netlify only builds when the code changes, and new data is live the moment this
finishes — no deploy at all.

LAYOUT
Flat names would have worked with a single redirect, but the bucket then holds
2,477 files in one heap. Grouping by asset class and category keeps it navigable
as it grows, and mirrors how the dashboard is actually used: every screen is
scoped to one category.

    meta.json  indices.json  glance_<view>.json  watchlist_<mode>.json
    index/<index_id>.json
    equity/<slug>/  category_<view>.json  quartiles_<mode>.json
                    rolling.json  risk.json  history.json
                    nav/<scheme_code>.json
    hybrid/<slug>/  ...
    debt/<slug>/    ...
    other/<slug>/   ...

The asset class of a slug comes from meta.json, and the category of a fund from
the category tables — both already published, so a new category or fund needs no
change here.

Usage:
  python scripts/publish_data.py --plan        # print the layout, upload nothing
  python scripts/publish_data.py               # publish
  python scripts/publish_data.py --only nav/   # just one kind
  python scripts/publish_data.py --verify      # read a sample back from Neon
